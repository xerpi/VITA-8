## VITA-8
The first CHIP-8 emulator for the PSVita (more like a homebrew PoC than anything else).

## Compiling
Prerequisites:
* arm gcc ([devkitARM r44] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/devkitARM_r44/) for example)
* [psp2sdk] (https://github.com/173210/psp2sdk)

Once all the prerequisites have been met, you can compile this homebrew by typing:
```
	$ make
```
